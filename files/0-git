Ignoring Files:

Create a .gitignore file in the root of your repository to specify files and 
directories to ignore.  For example:

*.log
temp/*


Common .gitignore entries:

/target/
/build/
*.class
*.pyc


Note:  Replace <file>, <branch>, and <url> with actual file names, branch 
names, and URLs.  Always commit your changes before switching branches.
